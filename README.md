# DOS-Assessment
Assessment for Digital Outsource

Hi Guys,

I have added a user note for the SQL portion of the test inside the appropriate folder.

For the API portion, I have added a file called "User Notes" which can be found in the root of the project or when the project is run in debug mode, the home page will contain a link to the text file.

Regards,
Dan Tromp
