Assuming that the windows feature MSMQ is enabled from the control panel:

I haven't worked with MSMQ before but please test by running the "DOS Assessment" project in Debug.
Once running, please see the below test requests I used to test the controller.

You'll just have to change the localhost port.
NOTE: I used Fiddler as my request client to test with.

Unit tests are not implemented correctly, again I haven't worked with them before and will make sure to read up on them.
